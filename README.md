# MADMAX-AE

This repository is for Artifact Evaluation of the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) 2024 paper **MAD Max Beyond Single-Node: Enabling Large Machine Learning Model Acceleration on Distributed Systems**.

The two main folders for reproducing the performance model results in the paper are:

- `artfiact_notebooks` - Jupyter Notebooks used for launching experiments to recreate performance model results
  - `[0] Cloud Provider Launcher.ipynb` - used for recreating Figures 1 and 16
  - `[1] DLRM A Validation.ipynb` - used for recreating Figure 7

- `artifact_sheets` - Microsoft Excel sheets that contain organized data of experiment results
  - `[A] Cloud Provider Results.xlsx` - supplemental data used in Figures 1 and 16
 
The other files are used to support the performance model itself. *\<More to come on description of files' structure.\>*

**Please note that these two folders are still works in progress and will updated over the next couple of days.**
